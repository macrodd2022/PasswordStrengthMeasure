## Broken thoughts 碎碎念

Our team project was originally about another subject. However, one night I came up with this idea. Unfortunately the another project already had some progress and my teammates refused to change project. But I really liked this, so I finished this alone.

我们的团队作业本来是关于另外一个主题，但是一天晚上我想起了这个主意。不幸的是，另外那个项目已经有一些进展了，而且我的队友不愿意更改项目。然而我又喜欢这个，于是我单人完成了。
